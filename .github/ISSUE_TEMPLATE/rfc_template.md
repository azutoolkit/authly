## 1 TL;DR

<!--
short paragraph or bullet list that quickly explains what you're trying to do
-->

## 2 Motivation

<!--
What motivates this decision and why is it important?
Here we aim to get comfortable articulating the value of our actions.
-->

## 3 Proposed Implementation

<!--
This is the core of your proposal, and it's purpose is to help you think through the problem, because writing is thinking https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/writing-is-thinking-an-annotated-twitter-thread-2a75fe07fade

  - use diagrams to help illustrate your ideas
  - include code examples if you're proposing an interface or system contract
  - link to project briefs or wireframes that are relevant

The intent of this section can be summarized as:

"This is the direction we're taking, can anyone think of any reasons why we shouldn't move forward with this?"
 -->

## 4 Metrics & Dashboards

<!--
What are the main metrics we should be meassuring? For example, when interacting with an external system it might be
the external system latency. When adding a new table, how fast would it fill up?
-->

## 5 Drawbacks

<!--
Are there any reasons why we should not do this?
Here we aim to evaluate risk and check ourselves
-->

## 6 Alternatives

<!--
What are other ways of getting the same outcome?
-->

## 7 Potential Impact and Dependencies

<!--
  What other systems or teams are affected by this proposal?
  How could this be exploited by malicious attackers?
  Here we aim to be mindful of our environment, and generate empathy towards others who may be impacted by our decisions.
  Consider explicitly assigning impacted folks as reviewers in this proposal.

## 8 Unresolved questions

<!--
What parts of the proposal are still TBD?
-->

## 9 Conclusion

<!--
Here you outline why this is the right decision to make at the time, and move forward!
-->

## 10 RFC Process, remove this section when done

<!--
By writing an RFC, you're giving insight to your team on the direction you're taking. In many cases, there may not be a right or better decision, but we will likely learn from it. By authoring, you're making a decision on where you want us to go, and are looking for feedback on this direction from your team members, but ultimately the decision is yours. ðŸ’ª You got this ðŸ’ª

This document is:
 - a thinking exercise, prototype with words
 - a historical record, its value may decrease over time
 - a way to broadcast information
 - a mechanism to build trust
 - a tool to empower
 - a communication channel

This document is not:
 - a request for permission.
 - the most up to date representation of any process or system

- [ ] Copy template
- [ ] Draft RFC (think of it as a wireframe)
- [ ] Share as WIP with folks you trust, to gut-check
- [ ] Send pull request when comfortable
- [ ] Label accordingly
- [ ] Assign reviewers (ask your manager if in doubt)
- [ ] Merge yourself with 2 approved reviews


### Recommendations

- Tag RFC title with [WIP] if you're still ironing out details.
- Tag RFC title with [newbie] if you're trying out something experimental, or you're not completely convinced of what you're proposing.
- Tag RFC title with [SWARCH] if you'd like to schedule a SWARCH review to discuss the RFC.
- If there are areas that you're not convinced on, tag people who you consider may know about this and ask for their input.
- If you have doubts, ask your manager for help moving something forward.
- As the author/s, this is _your decision_ and are empowered to choose to move forward despite dissenting comment. We're not looking for consensus driven decision making.
- The success of the implementation of your proposal depends on how this decision relates to our company objectives and priorities.
